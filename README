to install execute `make; sudo make install`


to build execute `sudo make -f Makefile32 install ` for ia32 build or `sudo make -f Makefile64 install` for ia64 build

to build the system default, you can just execute 'sudo make install'


on ubuntu you may need to install for ia32 build on 64 bit platform:

 sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
 sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386


for examples of how to use to mock a function see test.c 
to use this add to your compile commandline `pkg-config ExtremeCUnit --cflags` and to the link command line `pkg-config ExtremeCUnit --libs`

to build and run the test app, you need to install my ExtremeCUnit testing framework https://github.com/acgreek/ExtremeCUnit, then in this directory, execute 'make run', if you see no errors all tests passed. To version status of each test execute dist/test -v
